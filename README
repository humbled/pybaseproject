# Meta: Have used 'pybase' as the useless docker image (repository) name. Replace the intended name for your image

Prep the dependencies:
  mkdir -p wheelhouse
  docker build -t pybase:latest -f build.docker .
  docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/application -v "$(pwd)"/wheelhouse:/wheelhouse pybase
and re-run these if deps change.
In IDE (eg pydev in eclipse) add all as a dependency to pythonpath

Build the runtime services:
  docker-compose build
  
Run the associated containers. This will pick up code changes under the current dir because of the volume setup, so no need to rebuild
  docker-compose up -d
